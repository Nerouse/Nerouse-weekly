title: Why did you decide to take a course in open source software?
---
### Post 1

I decided to take this open source software course because I was interested in it. When I started learning how to code I often heard
people telling me to contribute to open source programs when I had free time because it would look good on my resume and it would help me
learn more as a programmer. But at the time, I was trying to make shapes by printing asterisk. Now that I have become a better programmer, 
I would like to contribute to other programs. After learning more about open source, I learned that I could take programs that other
people created and modify it so that it fits my needs and there are people who are willing to teach you when you contribute to an
open source software. Taking a course in open source software can help me strenghten my knowledge in contributing to open source programs.
